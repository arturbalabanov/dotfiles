Scripts
=======


A collection of the scripts I've created and use every day.

To use them, clone this repo and link them in to a directory in your
:code:`$PATH`.

:code:`git-cmt`
---------------

Intended to be a direct replacement of :code:`git-commit` -- behaves the same
way with the addition of inserting the relevant JIRA and GitLab references in
the commit message (:code:`git-cmt -h` for more info).
